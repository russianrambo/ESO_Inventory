# ESO_Inventory
An imitation of the inventory system from The Elder Scrolls Online.

Game info:
The Elder Scrolls Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing video game developed by ZeniMax Online Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks in 2014.

Project Info:
This project imitates the game's inventory system.
Resources Used: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML), in-game taken screenshots(Resolution: 1600x900; 'png' format).

Limitations:
1. Resolution: 1600x900. If switched to the Full Screen Mode, the program will adapt to the resolution of the user's screen. In other words, if your screen resolution isn't 1600x900, the images displayed will be distorted.
2. Not all inventory tabs are available. Right now there is no need to have more than 3 which are already there.
3. There are minor differences in how the toggle button works when switching between 2 sets of weapons.
4. You can't drag items out the equipment slots. The only way to unequip an item is to double-click it with LMB.

Note: The images I used in the project had been cut out of screenshots directly, so some things might not look pretty, but the whole program works fine without any issues so far.

Controls:
  Alt + Enter -> Full Screen Mode/Windowed Mode.
  Double-click or drag an item to equip it.
  Double-click an equipped item to unequip it.
  Esc to exit.
